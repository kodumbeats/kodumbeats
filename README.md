Hi! :wave: I'm Brandon, a solutions architect, linux sysadmin, devops engineer, and raspberrypi (pi) enthusiast. I'm passionate about internet privacy/safety, and I like docs. A lot.

I started my tech career at [Linode](https://www.linode.com/community/user/bleckemby/answers) as a linux specialist and on-call backups administrator. Now, as a consultant, I provide fullstack, linux, devops, docs, and support services. At home, I run most everything from a cluster of six pis: [k3s](https://k3s.io/), [pihole](https://pi-hole.net), [prom+grafana](https://grafana.com/oss/prometheus/), [gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/), [minio](https://min.io/), and others.

Let's chat about all that's cool in tech.

### Building:
- [ExpressionIO](https://expressionio.com): Automatable spreadsheet backed by an end-to-end encrypted database.
- docdownCMS: Simplify GMP documentation. Stop adjusting doc formatting - write in Markdown and get back to meaningful work.

### Maintaining: 
- [Min](https://minbrowser.org), a smarter web browser. ([source](https://github.com/minbrowser/min))
